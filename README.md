Rock Paper Scissors Game 


This is my rock paper scissors game which uses the random library, I was able to recreate the "pictures" of the rock,paper, and scissors, and using some if and else statements, create the code.


The Rules of Rock Paper Scissors is as follows:

in the file, the AI will choose rock,paper, or scissors. You will also choose one of the following and the match ups are compared and then a winner is declared.


paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper.
